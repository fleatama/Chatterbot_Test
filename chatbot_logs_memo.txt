zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> curl
curl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/curl/include"

For pkg-config to find curl you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig"


zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/opt/curl/share/zsh/site-functions
==> openssl@3
A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the system
keychain. To add additional certificates, place .pem files in
  /usr/local/etc/openssl@3/certs

and run
  /usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin/c_rehash

openssl@3 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides LibreSSL.

If you need to have openssl@3 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/include"

For pkg-config to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib/pkgconfig"

==> mysql
We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:
    mysql_secure_installation

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:
    mysql -uroot

To restart mysql after an upgrade:
  brew services restart mysql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/usr/local/var/mysql
==> postgresql
To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:
  brew postgresql-upgrade-database

This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgres
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-initdb.html

To restart postgresql after an upgrade:
  brew services restart postgresql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
